# This repository contains work I completed in the class, IST210, at Pennsylvania State University. IST210 is a class which provides an introduction to physical database design, data modeling, relational model, logical database design, and SQL query language.
# Lab 3 includes:
### Part 1: Select data from the hospital database using SQL SELECT statements to view the contents of each table.
### Part 2: Insert, update and delete data from the hospital database using SQL INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
##### I have attached a screenshot of the EERD in case the Hospital_EERD.mwb is not accessible to you:
